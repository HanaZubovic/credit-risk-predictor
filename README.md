# Credit Risk Predictor

## The Challenge
Create a machine learning model that will take loan data from an LendingClub's API and predict whether or not a loan will become 'high risk'. <br/>
For this challenge, we create two models: 
- Logistic Regression model
- Random Forest Classifier model

## File Directory
- Resources folder contains all `.csv` files including `.csv` files generated from online sources
- `Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb' contains the main script for the machine learning model to be viewed in Jupyter Notebook
  - Main script contains code for Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models

## Results
*The following is a snippet of the script used to build, train, and test the ML models*![Models](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16246354/156874946-dcd30c07-f6db-41dc-850c-c90593e7f9ab.png)
